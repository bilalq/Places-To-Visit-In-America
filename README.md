Places-To-Visit-In-America
==========================

I'm trying to see all 50 states by the time I'm 25.  This is a place for me to keep track of all the things I hear of which sound sweet.  

Also, this is github, so it would be awesome if this became a collaborative thing.  If you happen to come across this repo and notice something awesome that should be on here, feel free to add it.
